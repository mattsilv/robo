# Video Decisions — Source of Truth

**DO NOT CHANGE without explicit user approval.**

## Format
- Target: ~2 minutes, under 2:30 max (not close to 3 min)
- 1920x1080, 16:9, YouTube unlisted
- Audio-first: generate voiceover, align video to it
- Show the actual app running on a real device — no slide decks
- First 10 seconds decide if they keep watching

## Section Order (proven hackathon format)

| # | Section | Duration |
|---|---------|----------|
| 1 | Hook / Elevator Pitch | 10-15s |
| 2 | Problem Statement | 15-20s |
| 3 | Solution & Differentiator | 20-30s |
| 4 | Live Demo | 60-90s |
| 5 | Technical Highlights | 20-30s |
| 6 | Impact & Vision | 15-20s |
| 7 | Stinger (post-credits) | ~5s |

## Live Demos (exactly two)

### Demo A: LiDAR → Claude Code MCP → Web Visualization
1. Scan a room with LiDAR in Robo
2. Send scan data to Claude Code via MCP
3. Claude Code builds a web visualization of the floor plan
4. Show it running in browser

### Demo B: Group Think HIT — Ski Trip Planning
1. Open Robo chat, invoke Group Think via conversation
2. Scenario: planning a ski trip with friends, picking dates
3. Chat creates a HIT link, text it to friends
4. Show real-time notifications as friends respond
5. Results aggregate back in Robo

## Key Stats
- ~$550 of Claude API usage (source: site footer, updated 2/14)
- Built entirely with Claude Code
- Open source, no subscription, privacy-first free tier

## Stinger
- BLE beacon chip, LED blinks in sync with words
- Different voice (southern accent): "But what do I know? I'm just AI myself."
- Post-credits, ~5 seconds

## Emotional Arc
Curiosity → Pain recognition → Relief → Surprise → Inevitability → Delight

## Narrative Strategy
- LiDAR = fast credibility opener (~20s) — impressive tech, visual hook
- Group Think = emotional peak (~45s) — new behavior; judges remember behavior change, not sensors
- End on future reality, not features

## One-Sentence Pitch (locked)
"Robo turns your phone's real-world sensors and human input into APIs any AI agent can use instantly."

## Key Phrases to Include
- Judge-memory phrase (use twice): "AI can finally sense the world — and collaborate inside it."
- Transition between demos: "Sensing the world is only half the story. The real breakthrough is letting AI collaborate with humans instantly."
- Group Think landing: "AI doesn't replace people here. It coordinates them."
- Closing (before stinger): "This is the moment AI steps out of the chat window… and into the real world."
- Inevitability beat: "Once AI can sense spaces, scan objects, and ask humans for help in real time… every agent stops being a chatbot and starts becoming an actor in the real world."

## Tagline
"The Context Cultivator" — include if it fits naturally, not mandatory

## De-emphasize
- Framework names, integration method count, architecture depth
- Keep: cost stat, open source, real device demo, "built with Claude Code"

## Tone
- Direct, conversational, short sentences, no jargon
- Brief team intro for personality
- Visual, not a presentation
